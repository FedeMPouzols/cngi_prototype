MeasurementSet
===================

These functions examine or manipulate MS data in the Dask Dataframe (DF) format.  They
take a DF as input and return a new DF or some other structure as
output.  Some may operate directly on the Apache Parquet data store on
disk. 

The input DF is never modified.

To access these functions, use your favorite variation of:
``import cngi.ms``

.. automodsumm:: cngi.ms
