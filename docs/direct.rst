Direct Access
====================

These functions allow direct access to the underlying Dataframe model and Dask processing engine. In many cases this is easier than finding or writing a specific access method.

To access these functions, use your favorite variation of:
``import cngi.direct``

.. automodsumm:: cngi.direct
   :toctree: api
   :nosignatures:
   :functions-only:
