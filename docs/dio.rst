Data Input / Output
====================

Most CNGI functions operate on Dataframes or N-dim arrays while the
data is stored on disk in Apache Parquet format.  These functions
allow the transition back and forth between the two.

To access these functions, use your favorite variation of:
``import cngi.dio``

.. automodsumm:: cngi.dio
   :toctree: api
   :nosignatures:
