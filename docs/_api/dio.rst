Data Input / Output
====================

Most CNGI functions operate on xarray Datasets while the
data is stored on disk in Zarr format.  These functions
allow the transition back and forth between the two.

To access these functions, use your favorite variation of:
``import cngi.dio``

.. automodsumm:: cngi.dio
   :toctree: api
   :nosignatures:
   :functions-only:
