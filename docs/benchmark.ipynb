The zarr chunks are small -- 6.65 MB uncompressed (`time:23, baseline:903, chan:10, pol:2`) -- so we varied the size and number of dask chunks to keep the processors from starving for work, starting from a size of 903.87 MB (`time:782, baseline:903, chan:40, pol:2`) and decrementing along the time and channel dimensions to keep the number of dask chunks ~3x the number of vCPUs in the cluster.\n",
